The homework consists in analyzing the text of Airbnb property listings and building a search engine.



## Script descriptions

1. __`ADM_HW3.ipynb`__: 

This file contains our work about the airbnb in Texas.
The algorithms we used to clean the tsv file and get informations are all inside, they are descibed step by step.
Insisde *ADM_HW3.ipynp* you can also find our comments and our conclusions.


2. __`functions.py`__: 

Python file that contains several functions, we called and used them in *ADM_HW3.ipynb*.

3. __`MAP`__: 

It is a folder containg two MAPS. The maps a are about the last request of the HW:*Bonus Step: Make a nice visualization!*.
We didn't manage to load them inside the *ADM_HW3.ipynb* so we decided to load them seperatly. 
There are two maps, that represents:
'map_input' = the visualization of the coordinates and the radius given by the user as input, within which the search of booking is made.
'map_of_airbnb' = the visualization of all the bookings made that are within the radius; each of them has a 'popup' in the marker with the                     title of the specific stay.

4. __`.gitignore`__:
 The file was created by system and has no relation to the research
5. __`LICENSE`__:
 The file was created by system and has no relation to the research
 
. __`IMPORTANT`__:

During the HomeWork we used two folder that we didn't upload inside this repository.
They are called *docs* and *nltk*.
They contain text file about the single airbnb in Texas, we used them in *ADM_HW3.ipynb*.
During the HomeWork we needed to dump and load some .txt files. This made our jobs much easier. We didn't upload them inside this repository beacuse there were heavy. You can find information about these files reading *ADM_HW3.ipynb*.[d_bedroom;d_city;d_city1;d_city2;d_final_city;d_norma;d_price1;d_price3;inverted_index;inverted_index2;term_index;vocabulary;problems]
